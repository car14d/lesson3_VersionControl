            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is incredibly important to coders, especially ones who work in groups. It’s a system that records all the changes to one or multiple files over time, which allows for the coder to recall specific versions whenever they need. A VCS can also be important to web and graphic designers who want to keep every version of a certain layout or image, which lets them see every change and every detail that gets altered over a certain period of time. So basically, VCS permits mistakes and errors while at no cost to the designer or coder, which can be an extremely helpful tool when coding.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">During the time of the Linux kernel’s maintenance (1991-2002), any change added to the software were patches and archived files. In 2002, the project started to use BitKeeper, which was an exclusive distributed version control system. But around 2005, the relationship between the Linux kernel community and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper had collapsed, leaving the Linux kernel team with no DVCS. This did not stop the Linux team though, as they developed their own DVCS that focused on speed, simplicity, and data size, which we now know as the one and only Git. Since then, Git has evolved into an easy to use and fast DVCS that is fully distributed.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is considered a little unlike than most VCSs, as it stores and thinks about information much differently. The major difference is how Git thinks about data, for example, other VCSs think of information they store as a “set of files and the changes made to each file over time”, while Git thinks of its information as a “set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem”. So every single time you commit, Git takes a screenshot of what all the files look like at that moment and stores some sort of reference of that screenshot. There are many other differences, such as its use of local files and resources and the fact that everything is Git is check-summed before it is restored.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two main ways to get a Git project. The first focuses on an already existing project and then importing that into Git. With this method, you start with a “git init” command, which then creates a repository skeleton. Then, with three more commands, we end up “committing” our project which then starts tracking our files. The second method clones an existing repository from a whole other server. This way is a little shorter, as the main and only command used here is, “git clone”. What this does is pull down every version of the file for the project and then allows you to access those at any time.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Now let’s discuss how to record changes to the repository. Each file in the working directory can be in one or two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked means that the file is unmodified from the previous snapshot, while untracked means that the state the file was in has been changed since the last snapshot. As someone who uses Git, you go through a cycle of having tracked and untracked files. It’s similar to the coding cycle, but instead of saving, you’re committing. There are several commands involved in the process, such as  “git status” (to check the status of your files) as well as “.gitignore” (which ignores the tracked or untracked status of a specific file).</p>
